# NugetUnicorn

Here live Nuget Unicorns

This is supposed to be a useful tool for .net developers. Especially for those who have to manage large solutions using nuget packages. Well... you know, when some packages need some versions and their dependencies has its own idea of which package versions they need to use.
Once I've found myself struggling with a number of packages and their version restrictions, so I had to write all those version to a piece of paper to find what package can use what version.

So, as I am a bit lazy, I decided to write a tool that would do this (and some other stuff) for me.
